# Ethereum Wallet Generator

This script generates an Ethereum wallet using a mnemonic phrase and the `ethers.js` library. It prints the wallet details to the console.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the code snippet to a local file.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install ethers
```

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the script using Node.js:

```sh
node your-script-name.js
```

Replace `your-script-name.js` with the name of the file containing the provided code.

3. The script will generate an Ethereum wallet using the provided mnemonic phrase and print the wallet details to the console.


## Important Note

- Keep your mnemonic phrase (`mnemonic` variable) secure and do not share it with anyone. It provides access to your wallet.
